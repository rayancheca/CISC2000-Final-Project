The project aims to read course data from a file, perform various operations 
on the data, and generate output files based on the results. 
With this project, i aimed to read courses from CoursesFall2023.txt file and:
1.Generate a professor list along with IDs. Save to a file called professorsFall2023.txt
2.Produce a list of courses that overlap based on their timeslot using
overload for == indicating time overlap. This list is saved in the OverlappingCourses.txt file.

The main functionalities of the program include:
    -   Reading course data from the "CoursesFall2023.txt" file.
    -   Generating a list of professors along with their IDs and saving it to the "ProfessorsFall2023.txt" file.
    -   Identifying and producing a list of courses that overlap based on their timeslots and saving it to the "OverlappingCourses.txt" file.
    -   Implementing classes and their respective member functions to represent university members, course information, names, and IDs.
    -   Implementing the concept of inheritance by creating a class hierarchy.
    -   Demonstrating the use of overloaded operators in the Course class to compare courses for equality and determine time overlap.
    -   Performing I/O operations on files, including reading from and writing to files.
    -   Using vectors and sets to store and manipulate data.
    -   Implementing accessor and mutator functions to access and modify class members.

Features demonstrated in the project:
    -   I/O parsing a file for course data with additional functionality (including time information): +1
    -   Inheritance (UnivMember class): +1
    -   Overloaded operator== and overloaded operator<< (in Course class): +2
    -   New dynamic objects (Course objects, professors vector): +2
